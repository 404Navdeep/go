# Go!
A URL Shortener made on the domain go.navdeep.online!

This is a simple URL shortener that I made for my personal use. It is a simple and easy to use tool that allows you to shorten long URLs into shorter, more manageable ones.

## How it works
It works on a MongoDB database and uses a simple algorithm to generate short URLs.

A URL gets shortened to a random id or a custom id if you provide one. 
## Usage

This tool is not free to use and does require a AUTH Key to operate. You can use it as many times as you like, and there are no limits on the number of URLs you can shorten.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to contact me at wsp@navdeep.online.
## API
The API endpoint for shortening URLs is:
